The details of OTP that you may have forgotten or never known!

== Behaviors

[%autowidth]
|=================
|link:http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html[`gen_server`] |For implementing the server of a client-server relation
|link:http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_statem.html[`gen_statem`] |For implementing state machines
|link:http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_event.html[`gen_event`] |For implementing event handling functionality
|link:http://erlang.org/doc/man/supervisor.html[`supervisor`] |For implementing a supervisor in a supervision tree
|=================

== link:http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/applications.html[Applications]

[%autowidth, options="header"]
|=================
2+|Application Types
|*Applications* |Regular applications that define their own supervision tree
|*Libraries* |A simple collection of modules and doesn't implement an application behavior callback module
|=================

[options="header", cols="12,~"]
|=================
|Start Types |Affect on Runtime when Application Terminates
|`temporary` |Termination is reported but no other applications are terminated
|`transient` |If application terminates abnormally all other applications and the runtime system are terminated
|`permanent` |All other applications and the runtime system are terminated
|=================

== Supervisors

=== link:http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html#maximum-restart-intensity[Restart Intensity]

The supervisor's maximum restart intensity limits the number of restarts that can occur within an period of time. Restart intensity is specified as a map with two keys - `intensity` and `period`. Restarts are limited to the to number specified by `intensity` that occur within the number of seconds specified by `period`.

[.child-specs]
=== link:http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html#child-specification[Child Specs]

Child specs are maps with the following keys:

[%autowidth, options="header"]
|=================
|Key |Optional |Description
|`id` |required |An identifier to use for the process
|`start` |required |The MFA to use to start the process
|`restart` |optional |See the restart types
|`shutdown` |  optional |`brutal_kill` or an integer timeout for workers. Must be `infinity` for supervisors.
|`type` | optional| See the child types
|`modules` | optional| The callback module if there is one
|=================

[.child-types]
=== Child Types

[%autowidth]
|=================
| `worker` |Any process that is not a supervisor
| `supervisor` |A supervisor process
|=================

[.restart-types]
=== Restart Types

[%autowidth]
|=================
|`permanent` |The process is always restarted
|`temporary` |The process is never restarted
|`transient` |The process is only restarted if it terminates abnormally
|=================

[.restart-strategies]
=== Restart Strategies

[%autowidth, options="header"]
|=================
|Strategy |Description
|`one_for_one` |If one child process crashes only restart that process
|`one_for_all` |If one child process crashes all other child processes are terminated and all of them are restarted
|`rest_for_one` |If one child process crashes the rest of the child processes are terminated and the crashed process and other terminated processes are restarted
|`simple_one_for_one` |Like the one_for_one strategy, but it can only dynamically start processes from a single child spec
|=================
